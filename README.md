### Module Description

- **`main.py`** - Manages the main interface and coordinates between all modules
- **`mission_processor.py`** - Loads and processes mission data, provides filtering functions
- **`personnel_analyzer.py`** - Analyzes personnel data, provides classification and filtering functions
- **`report_generator.py`** - Generates detailed reports and exports data

## 📊 Data Structure

### Missions
```json
{
  "id": "M001",
  "location": "Kabul",
  "status": "Complete",
  "priority": "High"
}
```

### Personnel
```json
{
  "id": "P001",
  "name": "Smith",
  "rank": "Captain",
  "unit": "Alpha",
  "clearance": "Secret"
}
```

## 🔧 Development and Extension

### Adding New Functionality
The system is built in a modular way, making it easy to add new features:

1. Add new functions to existing modules
2. Create new modules
3. Extend the main interface

### Example of Adding a New Function
```python
# In mission_processor.py
def get_mission_by_id(missions, mission_id):
    """Returns mission by ID"""
    for mission in missions:
        if mission["id"] == mission_id:
            return mission
    return None
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "ModuleNotFoundError"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd intel-data-processor
python main.py
```

**Error: "Permission denied"**
```bash
# Check write permissions for the directory
chmod +w .
```
